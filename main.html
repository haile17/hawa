    <p> The aim of this project (Hawa) is providing enough information related to weather conditions for the society. Weather forecasting in general itâ€™s  important. because they are used to protect life and property.Forecasts based on temperature and precipitation are important to agriculture, and therefore to traders within commodity markets.
      We need weather forecasts to know what to wear, to plan our day and to prepare for natural hazards that may lie ahead. However, weather forecasts provide essential information for decision-making in many other areas:
      
      for safe transportation on land, by sea and in the air
      for managing fresh water resources,
      for sport, adventure and beach tourism,
      for agriculture, building infrastructure and energy management,
      for taking life-saving timely action in face of impending natural hazards such as tropical cyclones, floods, etc.
